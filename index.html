                    Once upon a time there were three little pigs. One pig
                    built a house of straw while the second pig built his
                    house with sticks. They built their houses very quickly
                    and then sang and danced all day because they were
                    lazy. The third little pig worked hard all day and built
                    his house with bricks. A big bad wolf saw the two little pigs, 
                    “What juicy tender meals they will make!” He chased the two pigs
                     and they ran and hid in their houses.
